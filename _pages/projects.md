## Contract Management Tool, Peabody Australia
An application was developed using Microsoft Excel and VBA in collaboration with [Peter Humphreys Pty Ltd](https://www.peterhumphreys.net/) to manage large volumes of contractual information for this large mining company. This application integrated seamlessly to the SPARC product (Sales Performance and Reporting of Contracts), and enabled the organisation to implement its governance requirements, mitigate against multiple risks and increase operational efficiency.

## Sales Performance and Reporting of Contracts (SPARC) Implementation, Peabody Australia
In collaboration with [Peter Humphreys Pty Ltd](https://www.peterhumphreys.net/), we developed a custom validation and verification framework for the migration of existing operational data from multiple sources into the SPARC product developed by Peter Humphreys Pty Ltd. This project resulted in significant gains in operational efficiency. Opportunities were also identified and implemented to add value to the data management process.

## UEFA Refereeing Assistance Program Viewer
**Project description:** As part of referee development, UEFA release Refereeing Assistance Programs that contain clips and analysis of various match incidents. In the past this has been in the form of a stand alone program. However, recently, a paid application is now required to view the clips. I have developed a simple GUI in Python to view the clips and associated technical decision.
