I am a PhD (Mathematics) student at Queensland University of Technology researching prioritisation techniques for elective surgery waiting lists. I graduated from a Bachelor of Mathematics degree majoring in Operations Research from QUT in 2020. I have a range of skills in mathematics, statistics, simulation, and data science.
