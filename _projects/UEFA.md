**Project description:** As part of referee development, UEFA release Refereeing Assistance Programs that contain clips and analysis of various match incidents. In the past this has been in the form of a stand alone program. However, recently, a paid application is now required to view the clips. I have developed a simple GUI in Python to view the clips and associated technical decision.
