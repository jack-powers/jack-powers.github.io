**Project description:** MPhil project looking into using mathematics to more equitably and transparently order public elective surgery patients in Queensland, Australia

### Broad Overview
In the Australian public health system, there is often a long waiting list for patients to access elective surgeries due
to high demand and limited capacity of the health system. Currently in Australia, patients are assigned a nationally
defined classification indicating the urgency of the surgery. For each of the three urgency categories, there is an
associated recommend time frame in which a patient should receive treatment: 

* Urgent (Category 1) — surgery recommended within 30 days of being added to the wait list
* Semi-urgent (Category 2)— surgery recommended within 90 days of being added to the wait list
* Non-urgent (Category 3) — surgery recommended within 365 days of being added to the wait list 

Priority scoring systems have been proposed in a range of literature as an alternative to the current three category
system, where patients are ranked according to some mathematical formula that take into account a patients’ clinical
factors and waiting time to generate a priority score. The aim of such a system is to enhance the equity of
waiting lists by utilising clear and defensible criteria to rank patients, increasing the transparency of the system
as well as actively ensuring that semi-urgent and non-urgent patients do not wait exceptional amounts of time for
care. However, the functional form of prioritisation formulas in the literature have largely been arbitrary. This
research will explore the use of genetic programming to optimise the functional form of the prioritisation formula
to maximise key performance metrics.
